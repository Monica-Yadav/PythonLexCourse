Write a python function that accepts a list of words and returns the list of integers representing the length of the corresponding words.


def list_of_count(word_list):
    count_list = []
    for n in word_list:
        count_list.append((len(n)))
    
    return count_list

word_list=["cat","Come"]
print(list_of_count(word_list))
