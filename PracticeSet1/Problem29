Given a list of numbers, write a python function to exchange the first n/2 elements of a list with the last n/2 elements. The function should return the new list.

n represents the number of elements in the list. Assume that it will always be even.



def exchange_list(number_list):
    #start writing your code here
    n = len(number_list)

# condition to check length is EVEN or not

# if lenght is ODD, show message and exit

    if( n%2 != 0 ):

        print ("List has ODD number of elements.")
    else:

# Create list1 with half elements (first 3 elements)

        list1 = number_list[0:n//2]

# Create list2 with next half elements (next 3 elements)

        list2 = number_list[n//2:n]
        list2.reverse()
        
        number_list=list2+list1
        
    
    return number_list
     
number_list=[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(exchange_list(number_list))
