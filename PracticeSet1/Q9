Write a Python function which generates and returns a dictionary 
where the keys are numbers between 1 and n (both inclusive) and the values are square of keys.



def generate_dict(number):
    d=dict()
    #start writing your code here
    for x in range(1,number+1):
        d[x]=x**2
    return d
	

number=20
print(generate_dict(number))
